# Problem Statement
# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring in it with no more than K distinct characters.

# Example 1:

# Input: String="araaci", K=2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '2' distinct characters is "araa".
# Example 2:

# Input: String="araaci", K=1
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The longest substring with no more than '1' distinct characters is "aa".
# Example 3:

# Input: String="cbbebi", K=3
# Output: 5
# Explanation: The longest substrings with no more than '3' distinct characters are "cbbeb" & "bbebi".

  start = 0
  max_length = 0

  # in the following loop we'll try to extend the range [start, end]
  for end in range(len(str)):
    right_char = str[end]
    char_frequency[right_char] += 1

    # shrink the sliding window, until we are left with 'k' distinct characters in the char_frequency
    while len(char_frequency) > k:
      left_char = str[start]
      char_frequency[left_char] -= 1
      if char_frequency[left_char] == 0:
        del char_frequency[left_char]
      start += 1  # shrink the window
    # remember the maximum length so far
    max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)
